# Arctic Blast (ARCBLAST)

**Developer:** Gary Plumley  
**Blockchain:** Ethereum Mainnet  
**Last Updated:** August 09, 2025

Arctic Blast (ARCBLAST) is a next‑generation ecosystem token designed for long‑term sustainability, investor appeal, and compounding utility. It combines **dynamic burn mechanics**, **tiered staking with governance boosts**, a **referral system**, **soft‑lock and auto‑compounding vaults**, and an integrated **launchpad** whose fees help fund buybacks, rewards, and ecosystem growth.

The project starts with a **$0 market cap** and a **circulating supply of 1,000,000,000 ARCBLAST** at launch. Emissions are released on a halving schedule, while fee revenue is recycled to support **staking rewards, treasury growth, buybacks, and liquidity**. Developer earnings are aligned with community success and capped/scaled to avoid over‑accumulation.
